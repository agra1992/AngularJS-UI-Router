WHAT IS ANGULARUI ROUTER?

The UI-Router is a routing framework for AngularJS built by the AngularUI team. It provides a different approach than ngRoute in that it changes your application views based on state of the application and not just the route URL.

FEATURES OF THE APP:
Angular UI Router over ngRoute
Nested Views
Multiple Views

Why would somebody use this approach? 
Each part has its own data, so having each with its own controllers and template files makes building something like this easy.
